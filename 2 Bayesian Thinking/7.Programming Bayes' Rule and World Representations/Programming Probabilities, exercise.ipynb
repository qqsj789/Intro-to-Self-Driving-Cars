    "In this lesson, you learned a lot about **Bayes' rule** and got more practice calculating the probability that an event will happen while working through examples. In the following quizzes, you'll be asked to write some simple functions that can help you calculate prior, joint, and total probabilities, given limited information. These will be useful calculations to understand and implement in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you write your code, it's good practice to test your code and work through any small errors that may occur, so I encourage you to run your code with some test probability values to see if your code is working the way you expect. The last cell in this notebook will also provide feedback on your output! \n",
